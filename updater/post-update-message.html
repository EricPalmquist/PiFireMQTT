    PiFire 1.7.0 Release - Month/Year TBD
</H1>

<p>
   This release contains bug fixes and feature updates since the previous version. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
    <i class="fa-regular fa-star"></i>&nbsp; <u>Here are just some of the <b>NEW</b> features that were added in this update:</u>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added experimental DSI based touch display, allowing for touch input from a DSI based display on the Raspberry Pi.  
        As of now, this is an experimental addition and should be expected to have bugs.  Performance is also a concern, as 
        this module utilizes PyGame for displaying graphics and getting input from the touch display.  This will be fairly 
        laggy on a Pi Zero 2W (or Pi 3 A+).   
    </li>
    <li>
        Exit Startup temperature (suggested by @EPGrillz), allows you to set a temperature/threshold where the grill will exit 
        startup and go into the next mode.  This can be configured in settings.  If the grill starts hot and has already exceeded 
        this temperature, then the grill will continue with startup for the normal amount of time.  
    </li>
    <li>
        ILI9341 display menu and encoder improvements (submitted by @dogtreatfairy). Improves the display menu readability, adds 
        back button and improves the encoder responsiveness. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Added ETA feature for any probe with notification set.  This ETA is calculated using an interpolation function (currently linear)
        which is still very much experimental.  This feature will continue to be worked on and enhanced.  
    </li>
    <li>
        Default and Basic dashboards now have the ability to show/hide cards including the hopper and status cards.  Look for the gear 
        icon in the corner of the window.  
    </li>
    <li>
        Default, Basic dashboards and Control Panel now have the ability to take keyboard input for hold and notification values.  Just click 
        value and change it using the keyboard.  The sliders will still work as normal if you prefer this.    
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a warning to the Configuration Wizard, when the system is running/active so that you don't have to wait until the very end 
        of the configuration to realize that you cannot submit changes.  (feature suggested by Discord user @Richie)
    </li>
    <li>
        Added support for v2.1.0 Android Application.  Thank you to @weberbox for updating the app to work with the latest PiFire changes!
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved visibility of save buttons on the settings page. (Suggested by @chrisusernamechanged)
    </li>
    <li>
        Behind the scenes improvements including:  Replace 'is_raspberry_pi' with 'is_real_hardware' functions planning for future
        platform support.  Add require_reboot flag to Wizard items (Added to PWM / DSI Touch Display devices) if a reboot is required
        when changing this configuration.  Add general commands list to Wizard items (Added to PWM board so no manual edits are required). 
        Added configuration for dashboards that allow extending/saving features for different dashboards.  Updated the ChartJS version to v3.9.1.
        Added common deep dictionary update function that allows dictionaries to be updated in a recursive way simplifying the logic of updating
        dictionaries. Adding system level capabilities so that future functionality can be added (i.e. wifi signal strength, undervolt detection)
    </li>
